# Random variables
## Continuous random variables
## Independent random variables

We say that two variables X, Y are *independent* if knowing the value of one of them does not change the probability distribution of the other. This means that for any pair of events A, B, P($X \in A$, $Y \in B$) = P($X \in A$)\*P($Y \in B$). In particular, P(X=x, Y=y) = P(X = x)\*P(Y = y)

# Binomial distribution

We make independent repetitions of an experiment, and count in how many repetitions an event happens.
If we make **n** repetitions:
