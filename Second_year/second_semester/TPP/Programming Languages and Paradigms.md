## Real Time

A real-time system must perform computations guaranteeing response **within time constraints**. They're classified into:
- **Hard real-time**: Unfulfilling a time constraint means total system failure
- **Soft real-time**: Unfulfilling a time constraint degrades the quality of the system

## Event-Driven

The flow of the program is determined by **events**. They can be **user actions**, **sensor outputs** or messages from other programs or threads. Usually they consist in a main event listener loop. GUI development tools rely on event-driven programming

## Reactive Programming

Consist on data streams and propagation of change. Easy to express **static** or **dynamic**. Based in the **Observer** design pattern, where the set of messages from the publisher to the subscribers is called **data flow**. **Reactive X** is the most popular API for reactive programming.

# Programming Technology

Those features and techniques offered by different programming languages and paradigms to design, build and maintain applications in a robust, secure, safe and efficient way. 

## C\#

C\# provides multiple features and techniques of different paradigms with different implementations.
- **OO paradigm**: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism...
- **Functional paradigm**: lambda functions, higher-order functions, closures...
- Standard API of **concurrent** programming and **parallelism**
- **Advanced features:** reflection, meta-programming, dynamic code generation...
